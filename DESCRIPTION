Description: This package provides bindings for the Osmium Library (libosmium) and allows fast processing of OpenStreetMap files.
  Supports the core features of Osmium, e.g. executing callback functions on each OSM object in a OSM file (xml or pbf),
  writing OSM objects to a new file, generating geometry representation (wkb) out of OSM objects.
  Provides a utility function for fast filtering on the C++ side 
  (e.g. execute callbacks on objects within a certain radius of a given location).
  The libosmium library is included in the package.
  libosmium is licensed under the Boost Software License, while 'Rosmium' (the 'Rcpp' bindings to libosmium) 
  is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later. The parser for the object filter is licensed under the MIT License.
